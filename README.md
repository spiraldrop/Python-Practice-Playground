# Basic Python Practice

## Overview

This project is a collection of basic Python exercises aimed at practicing different aspects of Python programming. It covers a range of tasks, from calculating multiplication tables to finding perfect numbers. Each task is implemented as a Python function or program. Below, you can find an overview of the tasks completed in this project:

## Tasks

1. **Multiplication Table**: This task involves writing a function that inputs a number and prints the multiplication table of that number.

2. **Twin Primes**: This program prints twin prime numbers less than 1000. Twin primes are pairs of consecutive odd prime numbers.

3. **Prime Factors**: This program finds the prime factors of a number. For example, the prime factors of 56 are 2, 2, 2, and 7.

4. **Permutations and Combinations**: This program implements the formulas for permutations and combinations.

5. **Decimal to Binary**: This function converts a decimal number to a binary number.

6. **Cubesum and Armstrong Numbers**: This task involves writing a function that accepts an integer and returns the sum of the cubes of individual digits of that number. It also includes functions to print Armstrong numbers and check whether a number is an Armstrong number.

7. **Product of Digits**: This function inputs a number and returns the product of its digits.

8. **Multiplicative Digital Root and Persistence**: This task involves writing functions that calculate the multiplicative digital root and multiplicative persistence of a number.

9. **Sum of Proper Divisors**: This function finds the sum of the proper divisors of a number. Proper divisors are numbers by which the given number is divisible, excluding the number itself.

10. **Perfect Numbers**: This program prints all the perfect numbers in a given range. A perfect number is a number for which the sum of its proper divisors equals the number itself.

11. **Amicable Numbers**: This program checks if two numbers are amicable numbers. Two different numbers are called amicable numbers if the sum of the proper divisors of each is equal to the other number.

12. **Filter Odd Numbers**: This program filters odd numbers in a list using the `filter()` function.
